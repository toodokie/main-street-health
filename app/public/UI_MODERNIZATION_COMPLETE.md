## Technical Implementation Details

### Modern JavaScript Components

```javascript
// New component architecture
class FilterEngine {
    constructor(appState) {
        this.appState = appState;
        this.initializeFilters();
    }
    // Handles all filtering logic
}

class UI {
    constructor(appState) {
        this.appState = appState;
        this.setupEventListeners();
    }
    // Manages UI state and rendering
}
```

### Enhanced Filter System
- **Status Filter**: All Images, Needs Optimization (default), Optimized
- **Priority Filter**: All Priorities, High (15+), Medium (10-14), Low (0-9)
- **Issues Filter**: All Issues, Missing ALT Text, No WebP, Large File Size
- **Real-time Count**: Shows filtered results count
- **Clear Filters**: One-click reset functionality

### Improved Table Structure
- **Responsive Columns**: Select, Image, Filename, Status, Priority, Size, Actions
- **Enhanced Thumbnails**: Proper 50x50px image previews with MSH styling
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators (optimized, needs-optimization, processing, error)
- **Priority Badges**: Visual priority levels (high, medium, low) with MSH colors
- **Action Buttons**: Clean action button styling with hover effects

### Modern CSS Architecture
- **Component-based**: Scoped CSS classes for each UI component
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with proper breakpoints
- **Brand Consistent**: MSH color palette throughout
- **Accessibility**: High contrast support and proper focus states

## Files Modified

1. **admin/image-optimizer-admin.php**: Updated to use modern JavaScript and clean HTML structure
