# Batch 3–4 Implementation Report (Context Engine)

## Overview
Batches 3 through 4 finalize the 2025 context engine rollout for the MSH Image Optimizer. The focus was on exposing manual context overrides to editors, wiring the new generator across analyzer/optimization flows, and removing leftover heuristics so metadata now depends exclusively on WordPress usage signals.

## Batch 3 – Attachment UI + Analyzer Surfacing
- Added the **Image Context** dropdown to the media edit screen (attachment sidebar) with auto/manual chips, service/asset highlights, and removal of deprecated `_msh_manual_edit` metadata.
- Context detection now respects `_msh_context` everywhere; analyzer responses include active/manual/auto labels so the UI and optimization pipeline share the same payloads (`inc/class-msh-image-optimizer.php`).
- Analyzer rows were updated to show context chips, service/asset highlights, and the meta preview block for editor review prior to running batch optimization (`assets/js/image-optimizer-admin.js`, `assets/css/image-optimizer-admin.css`).

## Batch 3.5 – Inline Context Overrides
- Introduced AJAX endpoint `msh_update_context` to save overrides directly from the analyzer table. The handler validates selections, updates `_msh_context`, refreshes `_msh_auto_context`, and returns a fully rehydrated image payload for the UI (`inc/class-msh-image-optimizer.php`).
- Analyzer table now exposes an inline edit icon that opens the context dropdown, saves via AJAX, keeps the row visible, and preserves existing filename suggestions/checkbox state (`assets/js/image-optimizer-admin.js`).
- Added supporting styles for the inline editor, edit button, and row highlight feedback (`assets/css/image-optimizer-admin.css`).

## Batch 4 – Cleanup & Legacy Removal
- Removed the legacy body-part fallback map from `extract_service_type()`, eliminating anatomy keyword heuristics so context classification depends solely on usage/taxonomies/manual overrides.
- Stopped writing `msh_metadata_source = auto_generated`; the meta key now appears only when editors make manual changes, reducing noise in the database.
- Documentation refreshed to describe the inline editor, removal of legacy heuristics, and revised cleanup scope (`MSH_IMAGE_OPTIMIZER_DOCUMENTATION.md`).

## Verification Notes
- Analyzer log during manual QA shows context updates for multiple attachments (IDs: 14531, 14770, 16117, 16120, 16116) with rows remaining in the results queue, confirming the inline editor refreshes data without forcing a full re-analyze.
- Spot-checked team/testimonial/icon overrides to ensure chips, meta preview, and filename suggestions remain consistent; existing suggestions persist after inline edits.
- No automated test suite is available for this plugin; validation relied on manual analyzer runs inside WP admin.

## Outstanding / Future Enhancements
- Bulk context updates, pattern learning for overrides, confidence scoring, and keyboard “quick fix” mode remain potential follow-ups but are out of scope for Batch 4.
- If desired, extend analyzer filtering to surface manual overrides or add a badge for recently edited rows.
