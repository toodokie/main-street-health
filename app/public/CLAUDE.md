# Main Street Health - Image Optimization System

## Project Goal
Create a comprehensive WordPress image optimization and duplicate cleanup tool for Main Street Health chiropractic and physiotherapy clinic in Hamilton, Ontario.

## Business Context
- **Client**: Main Street Health - chiropractic and physiotherapy practice
- **Location**: Hamilton, Ontario
- **Website**: WordPress site with Medicross parent theme + child theme
- **Image Library**: 748 total images, ~47 published images (found by optimized system)

## System Requirements

### Step 1: Image Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize all published images with WebP conversion and healthcare-specific metadata

**Features**:
- **WebP Conversion**: Create WebP versions (87-90% file size reduction) while preserving originals
- **Complete WordPress Field Optimization**:
  - Title: Professional healthcare titles
  - Caption: Marketing-friendly descriptions  
  - ALT Text: Accessibility + SEO descriptions with healthcare context
  - Description: Detailed SEO content
- **Smart Filename Suggestions**: SEO-friendly names (e.g., `msh-tmj-jaw-pain-treatment-3357.jpg`)
- **Batch Rename**: "📝 Apply Filename Suggestions" button to rename files
- **Healthcare Context Detection**: 
  - Dental images → TMJ/jaw treatment (appropriate for chiropractic)
  - Office/workplace pain → Ergonomics
  - Exercise equipment → Rehabilitation
- **Priority System**: Homepage (15+), Services (10-14), Blog (0-9)
- **Rich Results Table**: Thumbnails, priority colors, file sizes, actions

### Step 2: Duplicate Cleanup  
**Goal**: Find and safely remove duplicate images to organize media library

**Features**:
- Quick Scan vs Deep Library Scan
- Usage checking (prevents deletion of in-use images)
- Batch processing for 345+ duplicates found

## Current Status (UPDATED)

### ✅ COMPLETED (SQL Performance Fix)
- Site loads properly
- Complete admin interface at Media > Image Optimizer
- **SQL timeout FIXED** - analysis now completes in ~1-2 seconds ✅
- Root cause recorded: original `get_published_images()` made multiple SQL calls per attachment (featured image + `LIKE '%file_path%'` scans) across ~748 items, triggering repeated table scans and browser freezes.
- Fix summary: new `get_published_images()` loads attachment/meta in bulk, uses a single featured-image join, and scans published content once via `wp-image-{ID}` and upload URL matches—no more per-image queries, instant results.
- **47 published images found** and displayed ✅ 
- JavaScript click handlers working
- WebP delivery system functional
- Custom color palette implemented (#35332f, #faf9f6, #daff00)

### ❌ REMAINING TASKS
**Problem**: Basic results table missing rich functionality
**Missing Features**:
1. **Rich Results Table**: Need thumbnails, priority colors, file sizes like original
2. **Complete Optimization**: Title/Caption/ALT/Description + WebP conversion
3. **Filename Renaming**: Batch "📝 Apply Filename Suggestions" functionality
4. **Optimization Buttons**: High/Medium/All priority buttons should work
5. **Progress Stats**: Update progress overview after optimization

## Previous Success Reference
- Successfully optimized 34 images before with full functionality
- Had rich table interface with thumbnails and priority colors
- Filename suggestions and batch renaming worked
- All 4 WordPress fields were optimized (Title/Caption/ALT/Description)

## File Structure
```
/wp-content/themes/medicross-child/
├── admin/image-optimizer-admin.php (complete interface)
├── inc/
│   ├── class-msh-image-optimizer.php (SQL FIXED, need full optimization)
│   ├── class-msh-media-cleanup.php (working)
│   └── class-msh-webp-delivery.php (working)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/image-optimizer-admin.css (working)
│   └── js/image-optimizer-admin.js (need rich table display)
└── functions.php (all classes enabled)
```

## Technical Notes
- WordPress child theme approach
- AJAX-powered batch processing
- Custom color palette throughout UI
- Browser WebP detection with cookies
- Healthcare-specific image prioritization
- Nonce security + capability checks

## Success Metrics
- ✅ SQL performance fixed (1-2 seconds vs 60+ seconds timeout)
- ✅ 47 published images identified
- ❌ Need rich results table with thumbnails and priority colors
- ❌ Need complete optimization (Title/Caption/ALT/Description/WebP)
- ❌ Need filename renaming functionality
- Target: All 47 published images optimized with full functionality
- Cleanup: 345 duplicate images processed safely (Step 2)

## Next AI Instructions
The SQL timeout is FIXED ✅. Now need to restore the complete optimization functionality:

1. **Rich Results Display**: Restore thumbnails, priority colors, file sizes in results table
2. **Complete Optimization**: Implement Title/Caption/ALT/Description + WebP conversion
3. **Filename Suggestions**: Generate and enable batch renaming with "📝 Apply Filename Suggestions"
4. **Priority Buttons**: Enable High/Medium/All optimization buttons
5. **Progress Updates**: Update stats after optimization completes
6. **Test Full Workflow**: Optimize some images and verify all features work

The foundation is solid - just need to restore the rich functionality that was working before!
