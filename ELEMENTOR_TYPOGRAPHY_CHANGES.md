## Overview

This document details the implementation of a professional typography system that integrates Adobe Fonts and Google Fonts while providing Elementor-based global control for content managers.

## What was changed?

The hardcoded typography colors in the theme have been minimized to allow Elementor's global typography settings to take control.

### Files Modified:

1. **Parent theme style.css** - Removed hardcoded colors from:
   - `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6` - Removed `color: #051b2e`
   - `body` - Removed `color: #68747a`
   - Both now use `color: inherit` to respect Elementor's global settings

2. **Child theme typography.css** - **MAIN CHANGES** - Removed hardcoded colors from:
   - `h1` - Removed `color: #2D3E4E !important`
   - `h2` - Removed `color: #2D3E4E !important`
   - `h3` - Removed `color: #2D3E4E !important`
   - `h4` - Removed `color: #051A2D !important`
   - `h5` - Removed `color: #051A2D !important`
   - `body` - Removed `color: #2D3E4E`
   - `a` links - Removed `color: #2D3E4E !important`
   - `label` - Removed `color: #2D3E4E !important`
   - Added enhanced Elementor override rules

3. **custom-elementor-override.css** - New file created with:
   - Enhanced Elementor override rules
   - Proper inheritance for headings and text
   - Fallback styles for non-Elementor content

4. **functions.php** (theme-actions.php) - Added:
   - Enqueue of the new override CSS file
   - Proper dependency order to load after main styles

## How to control colors now:

### In Elementor:
1. **Go to**: WordPress Admin → Elementor → Settings → Style Tab
2. **Global Colors**: Set your brand colors here
3. **Global Fonts**: Configure H1-H6 colors in typography settings
4. **Widget Level**: Each heading/text widget can override global settings

### For individual elements:
- **Heading Widget**: Style tab → Typography → Text Color
- **Text Editor Widget**: Style tab → Typography → Text Color
- **Any Widget**: Most widgets now inherit from global settings

## Benefits:

✅ **Easier Color Management**: Control all typography colors from Elementor's interface
✅ **Consistent Branding**: Global color scheme applies site-wide
✅ **Flexible Overrides**: Can still override colors per widget when needed
✅ **Theme Independence**: Colors won't reset when updating the theme

## Fallback:

If you need to restore the old hardcoded colors:

1. In `style.css` around lines 1380 and 1311, change:
   ```css
   /* From: */
   color: inherit;
   
   /* To: */
   color: #051b2e; /* for headings */
   color: #68747a; /* for body text */
   ```

2. Remove or comment out the new CSS file enqueue in `theme-actions.php`

## Testing:

1. Go to Elementor → Settings → Style
2. Set up your Global Colors
3. Configure Global Typography for H1-H6
4. Check that colors are applied site-wide
5. Test individual widget color overrides

Your typography colors are now fully manageable through the Elementor interface!
